## What information is shown here?
On this page you will find all materials and products that are known in the Madaster database, other publicly available databases and all products that you have entered yourself on the platform (through the process; enrichment of a source file). Under the filter 'Source' on the left side you will find a list of the available databases with materials and products to which you have access. All materials and products from the Madaster database can be found by selecting 'Madaster' in the filter. Your own materials and products can be found by filtering on the name of your own account. Other users outside your account cannot see the materials you have added, they can only see what they have added themselves. If you want an overview of materials and products that have been added within your account, you can use the filter icon to make a selection of the desired data. The Madaster database is visible to every user. This data can not be changed. Materials and products that have been added can be edited, but this depends on the rights of the user.

If you only want to see materials in the overview, you can open the filter 'product type'. When you then select 'Material' below, you will only see the materials that are known within the Madaster platform. Within Madaster, we have four types of products in addition to materials: Volume, Area, Length and Pieces of products. If you do not know exactly what type of product you are looking for, you can select all 4 types, in which case all products will be shown.

## HOW DO I ADD A NEW MATERIAL?
There are two ways to add a new material:
1. Under the tab 'Materials & Products' on the administration page, in the bar under the name of the tab, there is the button 'Add material'.

2. It is also possible to add a new material from the enrichment point of view. You can access this screen by clicking on the 'View details' button behind a source file. Then you can go to the second tab 'Enrich'. Here you can see an overview of all elements from your source file. If the element is not yet linked, you can click on the 'link' icon. A screen will appear with a heading 'Create new' and click on the button 'Material' below it. If the element is already connected, you can click on the three dots at the end of the line and then on 'Re-connect'. The same screen as described above will appear.

Both options will bring you to the screen to add a new material. Fill in all information about the material where fields marked with a * are mandatory fields. It is possible to enter the name and description in six languages. It is only mandatory to enter the name in the language selected within the platform. If no name and/or description has been entered in the other languages, the name and/or description will be copied to the other languages. Once you have entered all the information at the bottom of the page, press the 'Save' button. The material is currently being created in the database and can now be found in the materials and products overview.

This will take you to the screen to further specify the data of the material you have just added. By going through the various tabs, you can enter additional data, for example in the field of search criteria and financial information.

## HOW DO I CHANGE MATERIAL AND/OR PRODUCT DATA?
If you have rights to edit materials and products, you can see a 'nut' icon at the end of the line. Clicking this icon will take you to the screen to edit the data. Change the data you want to change. For example, you can change the name of the material/product or the supplier. What cannot be changed with a product is the type of product. Click on the 'Save' button to edit the data and return to the overview.

## RESULTS AFTER ENRICHMENT
The overview below shows the result of linking elements from the imported file to materials and products in the Madaster platform. A distinction is made here between the automatically linked elements (in blue) and elements linked by you yourself (green). Make sure that the percentages are as high as possible to get the best results. You can always enrich after activation.


### PERCENTAGE OF LINKED ELEMENTS
- Based on number of elements; the percentage of the total number of elements linked to a product or material. Here you can see the improvements compared to the first automatic matching.
- Based on volume; ; the percentage of the total volume that is linked to a product or material. Here it becomes visible what the improvements are compared to the first automatic matching.


### ACTIVATE THE FILE FOR THE BUILD DATA : CONFIRM
This activates the file including all enrichment for use in the Madaster overviews and e.g. a material passport.

**RE-DO AUTOMATIC (ENRICHMENT) PROCESS**  This button in the toolbar allows you to go through the automatic matching process again _only for elements that have not been matched_. For example, to choose another source, or to automatically start matching new materials or products.

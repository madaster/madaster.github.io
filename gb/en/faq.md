## What information is shown here?
When you log in to the platform, you start on the home screen by default. This is where the main screen shows the most recent items you have worked on, or viewed. On the left you will see a foldable 'navigation drawer', which contains favourites, an overview of folders and buildings you have access to, and platform functionalities. When you log in for the first time, you first need to create one or more folder types, which you can use to organize your account. To do so, click on the name of your account in the navigation drawer.

### WHAT CAN I DO WITH THE BLUE MENU BAR?
The blue menu bar shows the number of functionalities:
- **Favourites** : a "star"; this allows you to create a "favourite" anytime, anywhere. These are shown at the top of the 'navigation drawer';
- **Notifications** : a "bell"; messages and notifications are shown here;
- **Information** : an "i-tje"; description of available functions on that page;
- **Settings** : "three dots"; that give access to your profile, system settings and a logout option.


### HOW DO I NAVIGATE EASILY AND QUICKLY THROUGH THE PLATFORM?
On every page in the platform, you will find the so called ""crumb path"" at the top. With this pad you can always go back to a page you have been to before. From every page you can take one or more steps back by clicking on one of the items in this breadcrumb trail. You can always go back to the home page by clicking on the first item ""Home"" in the breadcrumb trail. On every page there is the possibility to create a 'favourite'. These 'favourites' are shown at the top of the 'navigation drawer'.


### HOW DO I NAVIGATE EASILY AND QUICKLY THROUGH MY FOLDERS AND BUILDINGS?
In the 'navigation drawer' on the left side of the screen, all the accounts, folders and buildings you have access to will be visible. By means of the arrows you can unfold or collapse the folder structure.

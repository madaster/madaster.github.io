Create your account, structure your account, invite team members, customize your account settings, and manage your subscription

## Create your account

1. Go to <a href="https://registration.madaster.com" target="_blank">https://registration.madaster.com</a>, choose your country, and sign up for the appropriate subscription that matches your needs.
2. Check your inbox for a confirmation email. Use the link therein or go to the Madaster platform by logging in at <a href="https://platform.madaster.com/" target="_blank">https://platform.madaster.com</a>. Login with your company account if you have one with Microsoft. Otherwise register with your personal email.

## Create and organize folders

Madaster uses a flexible and customizable folder structure so users can stay organized based on their needs. Folders can store projects, databases, and other folders (e.g., a region, department, subsidiary, etc.). Before creating objects, a folder must be created.

1. From the account-level **General** tab, select **New folder**.
1. Select the <a href="../knowledge-base/folder-types-and-folder-structure" target="_blank">Folder Type</a>
   > Note: Madaster provides default folder types that can be modified or deleted. New folder types can also be added. Click <a href="../knowledge-base/folder-types-and-folder-structure" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on editing the account’s folder types.
1. **Name** the folder. A Description and a Logo are optional. Click **Save**.
1. If necessary, create <a href="../knowledge-base/folder-types-and-folder-structure" target="_blank">Folders within folders</a> to establish a hierarchical folder structure, or folder tree.

## Invite and organize your team

From your account, individual users can be added. Madaster enables each user to have their own access and permissions. 

1. Click on your **Account name** in the left navigation menu.
1. On the right side the tab <a href="../knowledge-base/users.html" target="_blank">Users</a> is found behind the 3 dots.
1. Click **Add user**.
   >Note: Users added at account-level gain access to all current and future folders, projects and databases within the account. If desirable, a user’s access can be limited to a folder (including all sub-folders), or to a specific object. In such cases, the folder or project must already be created. Click <a href="../knowledge-base/users" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on inviting users and managing permissions.
1. Enter the user’s **E-mail address** and assign <a href="../knowledge-base/users" target="_blank">Permission</a>.
   
   Invited users will receive an E-mail with instructions to join the account: 
     * New users with no existing profile/login must register to join the account.
     * Users with existing profiles can join the account using their existing user profile/login. 
1. To modify user roles and permissions, click on the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi-pencil-outline'/> icon on the right.
   > Note: User roles and permissions can only be edited at the level (account, folder, object) where they were originally established.
1. To delete users, click on the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi-delete'/> icon on the right.

## Customize default account settings

1. If desired, create custom <a href="../platform-pages/account/uploadpresets" target="_blank">Presets for Source File Uploads</a> within the account-level **Presets for upload** tab.
1. <a href="../platform-pages/account/passportpresets" target="_blank">Presets for passports</a>
1. <a href="../platform-pages/account/datasettings" target="_blank">Data settings</a>

## Use Features

1. If desired, activate, use and evaluate new <a href="../knowledge-base/features" target="_blank">Features</a> from the account-level **Features** tab. Click <a href="../knowledge-base/features" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on Features.

## Manage your subscription

1. At account-level, click **Subscription** in the top navigation.
1. View the summary and detailed information.
1. Modify or cancel your subscription.

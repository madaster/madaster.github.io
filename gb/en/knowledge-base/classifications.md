Methodologies used for in-platform classifications

## Shearing Layers 

* The theory and use of Brand Shearing Layers.
* Theory of the Shearing Layers was initiated by architect Frank Duffy and elaborated by Steward Brand in his book "How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built". The core of this idea is, that a building can be divided into six layers (quoted from Brand):
 1. Surroundings (eternal) := the first layer is the Surroundings, the geographical setting in which the building was positioned.
 2. Structure (30-300 years) := the second layer is the Structure of a buillding: the foundation and load-bearing elements.
 3. Skin (±20 years) := the third layer is the Skin or façade of a building.
 4. Services (> 7-15 years) := the fourth layer consists of the Services of a building, the so-called working guts: communications wiring, electrical wiring, plumbing, fire sprinkler systems, HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning), and moving parts like elevators and escalators.
 5. Space plan (3-30 years) := the fifth layer consists of the Space Plan of a building - the interior layout of walls, ceilings, floors and doors.
 6. Stuff := the sixth layer consists of the Stuff within a building: chairs, desks, phones, pictures, kitchen appliances, lamps, hairbrushes... all those things that are around daily to monthly.
and each layer, including every element inside that layer, has a distinct longevity.

e.g. elements in the layer "Skin" are exchanged more regularly than those in the "Structure", however not as frequently as those elements in the "Stuff" layer.

## Building Element Classification

* Building Element Classifications are used to list materials and products in the correct Building Layers according to Shearing Layer of Brand. This way, the outcomes of each calculation can be structured into distinct layers for both individual and comprehensive analysis.
* Most countries have their own standards for building element classifications (Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.madaster.com/nl/en/knowledge-base/madaster-glossary.html" target="_blank">Glossary - Industry Standards and your country</a>). The Madaster platform allows you to read your national classification from the BIM files and map it to the layers of the building. 

## NL-SfB Table 3 Material Classification 

Generally the NL-SfB classification system NL-SfB ("Nederlandse basisindeling voor de bouw", which translates to "Dutch Basis Classification for Construction") is a conding system used in the construction industry that organizes building related information.
This is done in different categories/tables, one of which being the Material Classification (table 3). The Madaster V2 Classification is a reference to the NL-SfB establishe material classifications.
The full NL-SfB classification is available for download in <a href="https://ketenstandaard.nl/app/uploads/2020/03/NL-SfB_Tabel_0-4_Update-V201912.xlsx" target="_blank">Excel form</a>.

## Building Usage Types 

There are different usages of buildings, with individual lifespans. For example an average school is planned to exist for 50 years, while an average apartment house is planned to exist for 75 years. This also influences the lifespan of the respective building layers.
Depending on the building use, the demolition costs are estimated as a value €/m<sup>2</sup> of gross surface area. This estimation can be overwritten, if more detailed information is available.

The following Building Usages are available on Madaster:
  * Accomodation Lodging
  * Community Small Complex
  * Community Large Complex
  * Community Theatre
  * Education MBO/ HBO/ WO
  * Secondary Education
  * Basic Education
  * Healthcare Carehome Row
  * Healthcare Carehome Detached
  * Healthcare Carehome Appartments
  * Healthcare Carehome Gallery
  * Industry Business Building Small
  * Industry Business Building Large
  * Other
  * Jail
  * Offices Small
  * Offices Large
  * Detached House
  * Semi Detached
  * Terraced House
  * Maisonette
  * Gallery House
  * Staircase Entrance Flat
  * Appartments
  * Corner House
  * Sports Hall
  * Swimming Pool
  * Indoor Shopping Center Unit
  * Outdoor Shopping Center Unit
  * Shop Unit Large
  * Shop Unit Small

The building Usage, the demolition costs as well as the building lifespan and shearing layer lifespans can be defined in the General Tab.

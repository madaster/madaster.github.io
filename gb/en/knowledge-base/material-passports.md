There are different types of passports now: the one-pager, an executive summary and a (full) passport that can include a technical annex with the base data in an excel file. Apart from that, it is now possible to preset what data can be included in the passport, such as the Madaster Circularity Index or any of the environmental KPIâ€™s.

When issueing a material passport, you can choose which type of passport needs to be generated and what information should be included in the passport. You can use a preset (if available) or select which information you want to be shown, like Circularity, Materials, Financial and Environmental information.

Here you can view the used files and classification methods, along with the used databases.

Each tab in Madaster is translated to the pdf, including the various graphs and calculations, along with some extra information about how these numbers are calculated ans should be interpreted. 

### Web-based Passport (one pager)

This passport is the same as the one pager mentioned above, but presented as a web page, for you to share with whom you want. You can just copy the URL and share it through email and the receipiant can read the one pager without having to login on the Madaster platform. They cannot see your object on Madaster, so be sure to include all the information you want to share.

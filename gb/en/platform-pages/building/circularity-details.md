## Circularity score
The value of the data stored in the Madaster platform increases as the value of the products and materials in the building is better preserved. In order to get a picture of how a building scores in the field of circular construction, the Circularity Indicator has been developed. The Madaster Circularity Indicator gives an indication of the degree of circularity of the building. A fully circular building achieves a score of 100%.

The Circularity Indicator assesses the building during 2 life phases: the materials to realise the building (ratio of new versus recycled materials) and how products and materials are processed at the end of the life span (ratio of re-use/recycling and waste to landfill or incineration).

The Madaster Circularity Indicator is based on the international open source Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. 


The information shown with the Circularity Indicator is based on the active source files uploaded with this building. It is vertically subdivided into the two phases of circularity, with the Circularity Score at the top. Next to this subdivision a horizontal subdivision is made in the six different layers of the building.


### The construction phase
- **Purpose**: 100% material from used sources.
- **Current calculation**: dynamic values for recycling/reuse percentages at product and material level. In addition to the Madaster Database (captured data on material categories and passed on to products), there is the possibility of manually enriching values based on practical knowledge.



### The end-of-life phase
**Goal**: 100% (high or low quality) reuse of released products and materials.
**Current calculation**: dynamic values for recycling/reuse percentages at product and material level. In addition to the Madaster Database (recorded data on material categories and passed on in products), it is possible to manually enrich values based on practical knowledge. The waste generated during the recycling process is also included in the calculation.

The quality of the source information will continue to determine the reliability of the Circularity Indicator. The provision of a source file with a high level of detail has a major influence on the quality of the indicator.

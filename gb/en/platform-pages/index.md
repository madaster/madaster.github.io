When you log in to the platform, you start on the home screen by default. This is where the main screen shows the most recent items you have worked on, or viewed. On the left you will see a foldable 'navigation drawer', which contains favorites, an overview of folders and buildings you have access to, and platform functionalities. When you log in for the first time, you first need to create one or more folder types, which you can use to organize your account. To do so, click on the name of your account in the navigation drawer.

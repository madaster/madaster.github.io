## Main screen


### Left margin
On the left hand side you will find a 'search' filter at the top. This allows you to search for a name or number in the database.

### Type of product
At Madaster we have four types of products: Volume, Surface, Length and Piece products. If you do not know exactly what type of product you are looking for, you can select all four types. In that case all products will be shown. If you only want to see materials in the overview you can open the filter 'product type'. When you then select 'Materials' below, you will only see the materials that are known within the Madaster platform.

### Compliance
You can filter on products that have environmental information in the selected compliancy filter

### Material Families
You can filter for products that have a certain material family in the selected material family filter.

### Main screen
This part of the screen shows all materials and products that meet the search or filter criteria. The columns display the name, the product code, the product type and the supplier respectively. Finally there are two icons: a 'pen' icon to modify the material or product, an arrow icon to display information about the material or product.

## How do I change material/product data?
If you have rights to edit materials and products, you can see a 'pen' icon at the end of the line, behind the material in the main screen. Clicking on this icon will take you to the screen of [product](../product.md) in question, in order to edit the data. Change the data you want to change. What cannot be changed with a product is the type of the product. Click on the 'Save' button to edit the data and return to the overview.

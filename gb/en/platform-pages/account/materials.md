## What information is shown here?
On this page you will find all products that are available in this account/folder: 
* Publicly available databases from suppliers or verified sources
* Databases shared with (or created within) your account on which you have rights.

## Left margin
On the left hand side you will find a 'search' filter at the top. This allows you to search for a name or number in all of the selected sources.

Under the closed filter 'Source' on the left hand side you will find a list of the available databases with products to which you have access:

- Your own products can be found by filtering on the name of your own database(s). Other users outside your account will not be able to see the materials you have added, they will only see what they have added themselves. If you want an overview with materials and products that have been added within your account, you can use the filter icon to make a selection of the desired data.
- Products from other sources can be found by selecting the relevant source or supplier in the filter.

### Product type
At Madaster we have six types of products : Volume, Length, Area and Quantity, Energy and Other Unit products. If you do not know exactly what type of product you are looking for, you can select all or none of the types. In that case all products will be shown. If you only want to see materials in the overview you can open the filter 'product type' and select the type you are looking for. 

### Manufacturer
If available and applicable, you can even filter on manufacturer of products. 

### Compliance
You can filter on products that have environmental information in the selected compliancy filter.

### Status
You can filter between active or inactive products. 

### Material Families (Madaster V2)
You can filter for products that have a certain material family or even sub family. For instance if you are looking for a product in the Timber family, You select 'I - Wood' and then the subfamilies are shown so you can select 'I1 - Timber'. 

### Other filters
There are more filters you can select, for instance based on your location or specific subscription. Use what you need to find your products. 

## Main screen
This part of the screen shows products that meet the search or filter criteria. The columns display the name, the product code, the product type and the supplier or manufacturer respectively. To see a more detailed information of the products, you can either click on the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi-arrow-right-circle-outline' /> icon at the end of a product row to navigate to the [product](../product.md) page or click the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi-chevron-down' /> icon to expand the product area and see a short description of the product, without leaving the page.

## How do I change product data?
If you have rights to edit products, you can see a <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi-pencil-outline' /> icon at the end of the line, behind the material in the main screen. Clicking on this icon will take you to the product information screen of the material or product in question, in order to edit the data. Change the data you want to change. What cannot be changed with a product is the type of the product. Click on the 'Save' button to edit the data and return to the overview.

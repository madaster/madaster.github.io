## What information is shown here?
You can create a new type of folder here, which can be applied to the entire account to create a suitable organizational structure for your Madaster account. You will see a button bar with the button to create a new folder type. Below that you will see the list of already created folder types.

## How do I add a new folder type?
Click on 'add folder type'. A new window will open.

- Enter the name of the folder type.
- Enter (if possible) the plural form of the folder type.
- If possible, enter a description of the folder type.

**Check the properties that this folder type will have:**

- Folder type allowed under account? (this type of folder can be used on the highest customizable level)
- Buildings can be added to this type of folder. (This type of folder can contain buildings. If not, it can only contain other folders)
- Is an address required before type of folder? (If so, an address must be entered if this type of folder is used)
- Is an area defined by spatial coordinates for this folder type? (If so, spatial coordinates should be defined if this folder type is used).
- Allow search criteria: Private search criterias on supplier or verified database can be added at the folder level of this folertype and will be applied to all buildings created under it[^1]. 
- CRREM report generation possible: normally, a CRREM report can only be generated for the whole account. If this option is enabled, a CRREM report can also be generated for folder of this type. (CRREM is a paid feature).

**Specify further:**

- Type of folders allowed as subfolders: determine which type of folders can be used as subfolder in this type of folder.
- Icon: give your folder an icon, which is visible in the margin.
- Logo: give your folder a logo, which becomes visible in the map of the folder.

Click on 'Save' or 'Cancel'.

[^1]: adding private searchcriteria **slows down** the matching process, use them wisely.

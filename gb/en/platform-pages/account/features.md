## What information is shown here?
Features are optional functionality that can be activated on an account.

The features pages shows the list of features available on the platform and shows if they are activated on your account.
Features can be in Preview mode: in this case, the functionality is still being tested and you can activate the feature to provide Madaster feedback.

Some features are available on invitation only.
Some features requires payment: a user with the billing role in your account can purchase the feature from the [Subscription](./subscriptions.md) tab

## What information is shown here?
Different users can be invited at each folder level, with three different role and permissions levels. Here you can invite users, or you can generate a so-called 'API key' to allow another system to access the folder(s) as a user.

The table provides insight into who has rights or this folder, the subfolders and/or buildings. You can select users, roles, and permissions.

### HOW CAN I DELETE USERS OR CHANGE THEIR ROLE AND PERMISSIONS?
A user can be deleted by clicking on the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi-delete'/> icon on the user row. A user's role and permissions can be modified by clicking on the <iconify-icon inline icon='mdi-pencil-outline'/> icon.

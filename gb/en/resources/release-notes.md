## Release notes 2025.2 ##

* Build number: 32489
* Release date: February 22nd 2025

### Draft products ###

It is now possible to put a product in a database in draft when you are still working on it:

Draft products are active products and have their own filter (publication status). A tag is shown as well to make it clear the product is in draft:

Draft products cannot be used to link to elements. Once a product has been used in a building it cannot be put in draft again.

### Assumed waste codes ###

If the Madaster platform has assumed waste codes of a product, based on for example the material composition, these will be shown in enrichment:

If the assumed waste code is correct it is possible to quickly add it to the element so it is actually connected to the element and will appear in reports:

### Other changes ###

* It is now possible to directly generate the technical annex when using the 'generate report' button on a building:

* The Madaster ID and external ID are no shown on a product in the platform when the product passport feature is active.

* It used to be necessary to have detachability filled in before you could fill in the percentage of 'available for reuse' on the circularity values of a product. This is no longer necessary.

* We have updated the 3D functionality so it can work better with big source files.

* It is now possible to set the following IFC properties in the upload settings:

* Build number: 31984
* Release date: January 10th 2025

### UI updates ###

Numerous updates have been made to the user interface in this version. Main and secondary actions can now be found in the same places. This standardises forms and thus contributes to user friendliness.

### Import progress bar

Users get a better insight into how far the upload of an ifc source file to the platform has progressed.

### Technical Annex on elements

In addition to the annex at product level, it is now possible to export a technical annex at element level. This is useful for checking the correct allocation of each element of an ifc file. In addition, you can get more detailed information about what the calculated results are based on.

### Country specific

* For Germany, the lifespan of a building that is taken into account in the environmental calculation can now deviate from the 50 years (specified by the DGNB). 
* Some products in the EPEA database were updated so that they are also available for the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland now.

## HOW TO ADD A NEW MATERIAL?
There are two ways to add a new material:

1.	Via the "Materials & Products" tab on the administration page, you will find the "Add Material" button in the bar under the name of the tab.

2.	It is also possible to add a new material during the enrichment process. You get to this screen by clicking on the arrow symbol behind a source file (at building level). You then navigate to the second tab "Enrich". Here you will see an overview of all the elements from your source file. If the element is not yet linked, you can click on the "Link" symbol. A screen will appear with the heading "Create New" and click on the "Material" button below it. If the element is already linked, you can click on the three dots at the end of the line and then click on "Link again". The same screen as above will appear.
Both options will take you to the screen to add a new material. Fill in all the information about the material, the fields marked with * are mandatory. It is possible to enter the name and description in six languages. It is only necessary to enter the name in the language selected on the platform. If no name and/or description has been entered in the other languages, the name and/or description will be copied to the other languages. After you have entered all the information at the bottom of the page, click on the "Save" button. The material is then created in the database and is now in the material and product overview.

### SEARCH CRITERIA ###
To further specify the data of the material you have just added, you need to provide additional information. It is imperative that (good) search criteria are entered! These are the search terms on which Madaster bases the automatic matching process after loading a source file. Always enter the complete and identical name of the material as a search criterion. However, it is preferable to enter more than one search criterion. A search criterion has a matching type:

- Contains
- Is equal to
- Starts with
- Ends with (This also helps when entering incomplete search terms as search criteria).

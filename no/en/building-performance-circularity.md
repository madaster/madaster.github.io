## What information is shown here?
The Madaster Circularity Indicator (MCI) and detachability of the building are displayed. When a benchmark is selected, and information is available, the building is compared to others. Below, the MCI, feedstock input and feedstock output are shown for each building layer. Unknown elements are shown to so they can be modified, and in turn included in calculations. 

### Madaster Circularity Indicator (MCI) _concept_
The Madaster Circularity Indicator (MCI) gives each building a score of 0-100%. A building constructed entirely from new materials which ends in a landfill is a fully "linear" building and scores 0% on the MCI. On the other hand, a building that consists entirely of recycled materials or reused products and can be completely reused in the future, is a completely "circular" building and scores 100% on the MCI. In practice, buildings will have a score between 0-100%.

The MCI assesses a building during 3 phases of its life:

__*Construction phase*__ : what is the ratio between "new" and "recycled, reused or renewable" raw materials?

__*Use phase*__: what is the expected life span of the products used compared to the average life span of comparable products?

__*End-of-life*__: what is the ratio of 'waste' to 're-use or recycling' of materials and products released during the renovation or demolition of a building?

The circularity assessment has 2 different determination methods:

- **Building Circularity Indicator**: CI score of the building based on the available data;
- **Madaster Circularity Indicator**: Corrected Building CI score based on correction factors.

The Building CI is corrected by two factors that include the completeness of the data set recorded in Madaster in the total score. A circular building and associated Materials Passport only works for products and materials that have been properly recorded. The correction is based on the completeness of the model based on the percentage of the mass of which the material is unknown, and the completeness of the model based on the percentage of the mass of which the NS 3451 coding is absent.

### DETACHABILITY
The detachability index at the building level is calculated according to a methodology described on the site of the Dutch Green Building Council.
Within Madaster, the calculation is made on all elements linked to products which have detachability information and an Environmental Cost Indicator.

### FEEDSTOCK INPUT AND OUTPUT
Input flows are classified based on Platform CB'23's definition of virgin and secondary feedstock. Virgin feedstock is divided into renewable and non-renewable material, with renewable material being further divided into sustainably produced and non-sustainably produced material. Secondary feedstock is divided into material from reuse and material from recycling.

Output flows are classified based on Platform CB'23's definition. Output is divided into material available for reuse, material available for recycling, material for landfill, and material for incineration.

### UNKNOWN ELEMENTS
Unknown elements are those that were not taken into account during calculations. These can occur for 3 different reasons:

__*Elements Unlinked*__ : these elements are not linked to material/product database, and thus cannot be reported on.

__*Elements with Unknown Layer*__: these elements are missing construction classification information, and thus cannot be assigned to a shearing layer.

__*Elements with Insufficient Geometry*__: these elements are lacking sufficient geometry, and thus cannot be used for calculations.

## What Information Is Shown Here?
The embodied carbon of the building and its layers is displayed. When a benchmark is selected, and information is available, the building is compared to others. Unknown elements are shown to so they can be modified, and in turn included in calculations. 

### Embodied Carbon
Embodied carbon measures the equivalent CO2 emissions released during the manufacturing (A1-A3), on-site construction (A4-A5), use (B1-B5), and disassembly (C1-C4) of a building. Since A1-A3 data is most commonly accessible, it is used to establish comparisons across shearing layers and different buildings.

The life cycle of a building is divided into the following stages:

__*A1-A3 Manufacturing of Materials and Products*__ : includes the raw material supply, transport, and manufacturing of building materials and products.

__*A4-A5 Construction of the Building*__: includes the transport to the construction site, and the assembly of materials and products into a completed building.

__*B1-B5 Maintenance, Repair and Replacement*__: includes the use, maintenance, repair, replacement, and refurbishment of materials and products within the building.

__*C1-C4 End of Life Processing*__: includes the deconstruction of a building, and the transport, waste processing, and disposal of its materials and products.

__*D Benefits and Loads beyond the System Boundary*__: includes the reuse and recycling potential of the building's materials and products. It is not guaranteed that reuse or recycling will occur in the future, thus stage D is an assumption and not included in full-building calculations.

### Embodied Carbon By Shearing Layer
The embodied carbon is shown by building layer across all life cycle stages. In this chart, it is easy to identify which building layer is responsible for releasing the largest amount of carbon.

### Embodied Carbon per m2 Across Building Life Cycle
The embodied carbon is shown across all life cycle stages. In this chart, it is easy to identify which building stage is responsible for releasing the largest amount of carbon.

### Unknown Elements
Unknown elements are those that were not taken into account during calculations. These can occur for 3 different reasons:

__*Elements Unlinked*__ : these elements are not linked to material/product database, and thus cannot be reported on.

__*Elements with Unknown Layer*__: these elements are missing construction classification information, and thus cannot be assigned to a shearing layer.

__*Elements with Insufficient Geometry*__: these elements are lacking sufficient geometry, and thus cannot be used for calculations.

## What information is shown here?
The information shown here is based on the active source files uploaded with this building. The table is divided horizontally into a material classification (Madaster or Table3-NL_SfB). Vertically, a subdivision is made into the different phases of the building process.

For each construction phase, the materials are shown in percentages. For example, you can see how much stony material will be demolished in the 'demolition' column. This is expressed as a percentage and in weight and volume. For this, an element in the source file must have been assigned the phase 'demolition'. This also applies to the phase 'new' in the building process.

By clicking on a circle, you will get more information. A new screen will open, in which you can see which materials and products have been used. For example, the material type 'brick' can be specified to the materials 'concrete' and 'brick' and to the products 'reinforced pillar' which in turn consists of 'brick'. The volume in which each material occurs can be seen.

It is also possible to click on a phase, for example 'Current' or 'Demolition'. You will then go to a new screen where you will get insight into the applied products of this specific phase. On this page you can filter by keyword and classification method (left column).


### WHICH PHASES DOES THE BUILDING PROCESS CONSIST OF?

- Current; the state of affairs at the start of the renovation;
- Demolition; all materials and products leaving the building;
- Casco; the state of affairs after demolition (calculation = Current minus Demolition);
- New; all new (virgin) and reused materials and products added to the building during the renovation;
- Final; the final result of the renovation (calculation = Casco plus New).

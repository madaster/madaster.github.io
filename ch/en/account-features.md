## What Information Is Shown Here?
The following features are available for your evaluation. Features can be toggled on and off in the account-level Features tab. Features are occasionally accessed invitation only, so please contact Madaster if you are interested in using them.

### Area Register
The Area Register plots all buildings within an account or folder on a map for aggregated reporting. Users can click on Area Register in the left Navigation Menu to view the map. Within the Area Register, users can zoom in and out, or draw custom boundaries (using Selection buttons in top right of map) to report on multiple buildings. Buildings within the map can be filtered by construction year and usage. The aggregated material mass can be exported to excel and downloaded within the dossier.

### Performance Dashboards and Benchmarking
At account- and folder-level, a new Performance dashboard is displayed. At building-level, four new dashboards are displayed: 1) overview, 2) mass, 3) circularity, and 4) embodied carbon. Benchmarking is made possible within the building-level performance overview dashboard. The dashboards are a first step in an iterative process to better communicate data within the platform, thus customer feedback is welcome and encouraged. With time, the existing tabs and new performance tabs will consolidate into a single location for enhanced user experience. For more detailed information, view the performance FAQ pages at account-, folder- and building-level.

### Madaster Infra
The Infra feature enables other object types (ex: kunstwerk) in addition to buildings in accordance with the BGT-classification.

### Embodied carbon overview
Display the total embodied carbon of your building on the General tab, based on linked products that contain environmental impact, expressed in "100-year Global Warming Potential per Gross Surface Area (kg CO2e/m2)". Prerequisite: one or more elements in the source file (IFC/Excel) must be linked to a product in Madaster that contains environmental impact information.

### EPEA Urban Mining Tool 
The EPEA Urban Mining Tool (UMT) predicts a building's material quantities based on easily accessible data inputs (Building Usage Type, Construction year, Gross Volume (m3), and Location. Additionally, the UMT generates estimations regarding embodied carbon. The UMT provides a “shortcut” to material and CO2 reporting for a building, portfolio, or entire municipality. Thus, clients without detailed excel files or BIM models are able to calculate information on their buildings.

### Split Building 
The Split Building feature allows users to create individual building dossiers and passports based on an IFC source file containing several buildings/homes. To use this function, an individual building number must be available for each IFC element in the IFC file. The property set and property name for this building number are flexible. This can be specified in the account-level Settings tab as a Preset for Upload. After an IFC source file containing several buildings/homes is uploaded and enriched, users can use the Split the Building button on the building’s General tab to automatically create individual building dossiers based on the assigned building numbers.

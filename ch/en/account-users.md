## What information is displayed here?
At the account level, users can be added with four different role and permission levels. 
From the users page, you can invite users or generate a so-called 'api-key' to give another system access.

The table provides insight into who has rights within the account, on the folders, subfolders and/or buildings. 
The tabled can be grouped by users, role, or object the permission was given on.


### How can I delete users or change their role and permission?
A user can be deleted by clicking on the bin icon on a user row.
A user's role and permission can be modified by clicking on the pen icon on a user row.


### Available roles and rights at the account level:

| Account level | Administrator | Manager & contributor to database | Manager | Reader |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Creating and modifying folder types | Yes | No | No |No.
| Creating folders | Yes|Yes|Yes|No
| Creating database |Yes|No|No|No
| Contributions to database created on account or shared with account with at least contribution rights | Yes |Yes | No |No

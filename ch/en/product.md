## HOW TO ADD A NEW PRODUCT?
There are two ways to add a new product:

1. Via the "Materials & Products" tab on the administration page, you will find the "Add Product" button in the bar under the name of the tab.

2. It is also possible to add a new product in the enrichment view. You can access this screen by clicking on the "Show details" button behind a source file. Subsequently, you can go to the second tab "Enrich". Here you will see an overview of all the elements from your source file. If the element is not yet linked, you can click on the "Link" icon. A screen appears with the heading "Create new". Click on the "Product" button below it. If the element is already linked, you can click on the three dots at the end of the line and then on "Link again". The same screen as described above appears.

Both options will take you to the screen to add a new product. Fill in all the information about the product, the fields marked with * are mandatory. It is possible to enter the name and description in six languages. It is only necessary to enter the name in the language selected on the platform. If no name and/or description has been entered in the other languages, the name and/or description will be copied to the other languages. In the "Product type" field, indicate whether the product is a volume product, an area product, a length product or a piece of a product (for example, a volume product can be a steel beam and a piece of a product can be an air conditioner). Please note that the "Product type" field cannot be changed after the product has been saved. After you have entered all the information at the bottom of the page, click on the "Save" button. The product is then created in the database and is now in the material and product overview.
You will be taken to the screen where you can enter further data about the product you have just added. By going through the various tabs you can enter additional data, e.g. in the field "Search criteria", "Product composition" and "Financial information".

### SEARCH CRITERIA ###
The screen appears for you to further specify the data of the product you have just added. By going through the different tabs, you can enter additional data. It is essential that (good) search criteria are entered! These are the search terms on which Madaster bases the automatic matching process after loading a source file. Always enter the full and identical name of the product as search criteria. But preferably for multiple search criteria. A search criterion has a matching type

- Contains
- Is equal to
- Starts with
- Ends with (This also helps when entering incomplete search terms as search criteria).

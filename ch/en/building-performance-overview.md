## WHAT INFORMATION IS SHOWN HERE?
The performance overview displays summary metrics for the building and its shearing layers. The building can also be compared to a user-defined benchmark. Additionally, the data sources for enrichment are shown.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The building and its shearing layers are measured by the following KPIs:

- **Mass**; measures the total mass of the materials, as well as the intensity of materials used per m2.
- **Circularity**; measures the Madaster Circularity Indicator, which is based on the degree of non-virgin materials used during construction, their utility, and their potential for reuse & recycling at end of use.
- **Detachability**; measures the degree to which materials and products can be disassembled without being damaged.
- **Embodied Carbon**; measures the equivalent CO2 emissions released during the production (A1-A3), installation (A4-A5), use (B1-B5), and disassembly (C1-C4) of a building. Since production data (A1-A3) is most commonly accessible, it is used to establish comparisons across shearing layers and different buildings. The embodied carbon intensity is also shown per m2. 
- **Material Value**; measures the future monetary value of materials at thier end of life, accounting for the costs of disassembly, transportation and processing for re-sale. The material value is also shown per m2. 

### BENCHMARKING
The building and its shearing layers can be compared to all buildings in the account or folder, and filtered by specific building types. 

### DATA SOURCES
The building's geometry has been matched with various databases to report on the KPIs above. Some data sources have been verified, meaning they have trustworthy, 3rd-party verification schemes in place.

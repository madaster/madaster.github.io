## WHAT INFORMATION IS SHOWN HERE?
The performance overview displays summary metrics for the building and its shearing layers. The building can also be compared to a user-defined benchmark. Additionally, the data sources for enrichment are shown.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The building and its shearing layers are measured by the following KPIs:

- **Mass**; measures the total mass of the materials, as well as the intensity of materials used per m2.
- **Circularity**; measures the Madaster Circularity Indicator (MCI), which is based on the degree of non-virgin materials used during construction, their utility, and their potential for reuse & recycling at end of use. The MCI applies a penalty for unknown materials.
- **Detachability**; measures the degree to which materials and products can be disassembled without being damaged.
- **Global Warming Potential (GWP)**; measures the equivalent CO2 emissions released during the production (A1-A3), installation (A4-A5), use (B1-B5), and disassembly (C1-C4) of a building. Since production data (A1-A3) is most commonly accessible, it is used to establish comparisons across shearing layers and different buildings. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) intensity is also shown per m2. 
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**; measures the present monetary value of materials at their end of life, accounting for the costs of disassembly, transportation and processing for re-sale. The Net Present Value (NPV) is also shown per m2. 

### Benchmarking
The building and its shearing layers can be compared to all buildings in the account or folder and filtered by specific building types. The benchmark is against all buildings within the benchmark settings, including buildings for which a user does not have read-rights. The benchmarks are described below:

- **Mass/m2**; the building benchmark is established by: 1) for each building in the benchmark, divide its mass by its gross surface area (m2), 2) sum the results, 3) divide by the number of buildings. The layer benchmark is established by: 1) for each layer of each building in the benchmark, divide its mass by the building's total gross surface area (m2), 2) sum the results, 3) divide by the number of buildings.
- **Circularity**; the building benchmark is established by: 1) for each building in the benchmark, sum the Madaster CI Scores, 2) divide by the number of buildings. The layer benchmark is established by: 1) for each layer of each building in the benchmark, sum the Madaster CI Scores, 2) divide by the number of buildings. 
- **Detachability**; the building benchmark is established by: 1) for each building in the benchmark, sum the Detachability Indexes, 2) divide by the number of buildings. The layer benchmark is established by: 1) for each layer of each building in the benchmark, sum the Detachability Indexes, 2) divide by the number of buildings. 
- **Global Warming Potential (GWP)/m2**; the building benchmark is established by: 1) for each building in the benchmark, divide its A1-A3 Global Warming Potential (GWP) (kg CO2e) by its gross surface area (m2), 2) sum the results, 3) divide by the number of buildings. The layer benchmark is established by: 1) for each layer of each building in the benchmark, divide its A1-A3 Global Warming Potential (GWP) (kg CO2e) by the building's total gross surface area (m2), 2) sum the results, 3) divide by the number of buildings.
- **Net Present Value (NPV)/m2**; the building benchmark is established by: 1) for each building in the benchmark, divide its Net Present Value (NPV) by its gross surface area (m2), 2) sum the results, 3) divide by the number of buildings. The layer benchmark is established by: 1) for each layer of each building in the benchmark, divide its Net Present Value (NPV) by the building's total gross surface area (m2), 2) sum the results, 3) divide by the number of buildings.

### DATA SOURCES
The building's geometry has been matched with various databases to report on the KPIs above. Some data sources have been verified, meaning they have trustworthy, 3rd-party verification schemes in place.

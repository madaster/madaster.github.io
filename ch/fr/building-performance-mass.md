## WHAT INFORMATION IS SHOWN HERE?
The mass of the building, and its layers, and its material families is displayed. When a benchmark is selected, and information is available, the building is compared to others. Unknown elements are shown to so they can be modified, and in turn included in calculations. 

### MASS BY SHEARING LAYER
A pie chart displays mass by shearing layer on the left. On the right, a stacked bar chart shows the material family composition of each shearing layer. Users can click on a bar in the stacked bar chart to view which materials and products are comprised within. Users can filter by material, floor, and source file.

Users can also click on a shearing layer in the pie chart. When doing so, all metrics become specific to the selected shearing layer. Additionally, the stacked bar chart on the right updates to show the material sub-families of the shearing layer. Again, users can click on a bar in the stacked bar chart to view which materials are comprised within. 

### MASS BY MATERIAL FAMILY
A pie chart displays mass by material family on the left. On the right, a stacked bar chart shows the distribution of material families across the shearing layers. Users can click on a bar in the stacked bar chart to view which materials are comprised within. Users can filter by material, floor, and source file.

Users can also click on a material family in the pie chart. When doing so, the total mass metric updates to be specific to the selected material family, and the material intensity and benchmarking metrics are be removed. Additionally, the stacked bar chart on the right updates to show the distribution of material sub-families across the shearing layers. Again, users can click on a bar in the stacked bar chart to view which exact materials are comprised within. 

### UNKNOWN ELEMENTS
Unknown elements are those that were not taken into account during calculations. These can occur for 3 different reasons:

__*Elements Unlinked*__ : these elements are not linked to material/product database, and thus cannot be reported on.

__*Elements with Unknown Layer*__: these elements are missing construction classification information, and thus cannot be assigned to a shearing layer.

__*Elements with Insufficient Geometry*__: these elements are lacking sufficient geometry, and thus cannot be used for calculations.

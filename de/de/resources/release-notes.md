## Release notes 2025.1 ##

* Build number: 31984
* Release date: January 10th 2025

### UI updates ###

Numerous updates have been made to the user interface in this version. Main and secondary actions can now be found in the same places. This standardises forms and thus contributes to user friendliness.

### Technical Annex on elements

In addition to the annex at product level, it is now possible to export a technical annex at element level. This is useful for checking the correct allocation of each element of an ifc file. In addition, you can get more detailed information about what the calculated results are based on.

### Country specific

For Germany, the **lifespan of a building** that is taken into account in the environmental calculation can now deviate from the 50 years (specified by the DGNB).

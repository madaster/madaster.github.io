## Circularity score _concept_
The value of the data stored in the Madaster platform increases as the value of the products and materials in the building is better preserved. In order to get a picture of how a building scores in the field of circular construction, the Circularity Indicator has been developed. The Madaster Circularity Indicator gives an indication of the degree of circularity of the building. A fully circular building achieves a score of 100%.

The Circularity Indicator assesses the building during 3 life phases: the materials to realise the building (ratio of new versus recycled materials), the life span (compared to average life) and how products and materials are processed at the end of the life span (ratio of re-use/recycling and waste to landfill or incineration).

The Madaster Circularity Indicator is based on the international open source Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The Circularity Indicator is in a development phase and has a low to moderate reliability caused by the unverified data of the products and materials used.


### EXTERNAL SOURCES
Various external sources contain detailed information about the products and materials used in buildings. This information is very valuable for future reuse. More and more databases will be linked to Madaster, so that this information will become available (also retrospectively) through one central place: the Madaster platform.


### WHAT IS NOW?
The information shown with the Circularity Indicator is based on the active source files uploaded with this building. It is vertically subdivided into the three phases of circularity, with the Circularity Score at the top. Next to this subdivision a horizontal subdivision is made in the six different shells of the building.

WHAT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT?
Circularity is still under development within the Madaster platform. Below is a brief description of the purpose of each phase within the circularity process and which steps still need to be taken to make the results reliable. We will work hard on this in the coming period.


### PHASE 1: THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE
- **Purpose**: 100% material from used sources.
- **Current calculation**: dynamic values for recycling/reuse percentages at product and material level. In addition to the Madaster Database (captured data on material categories and passed on to products), there is the possibility of manually enriching values based on practical knowledge.

**Development**
- Step 1: Linking external sources with recycling and reuse rates
- Step 2: development of a circular BIM Information Delivery Manual, laying down how the information is included in the source file.
- Step 3: Addition of waste from the production of materials, products and buildings.


### PHASE 2: THE USE PHASE
- **Purpose**: To maximise the functional life and useful life for circular products
- **Current calculation**: starting point for the current industry average lifespan are the Layers of Fire (location (500 yr.), construction (100 yr.), enclosure (20 yr.), installations (15 yr.), finishing (10 yr.) and interior (5 yr.)). For the current average lifespan, the starting point is the lifespan filled in by the user at building level. This is (possibly) adaptable at product level.

**Development**
- Step 1: in-depth information on functional, technical, economic and architectural lifespan in relation to the use and consumption of materials, products and buildings.
- Step 2: monitoring the lifespan of products and materials for individual buildings over time.


### PHASE 3: THE END-OF-LIFE PHASE
**Goal**: 100% (high or low quality) reuse of released products and materials.
**Current calculation**: dynamic values for recycling/reuse percentages at product and material level. In addition to the Madaster Database (recorded data on material categories and passed on in products), it is possible to manually enrich values based on practical knowledge. The waste generated during the recycling process is also included in the calculation.

**Development**
- Step 1: Link external sources with recycling and reuse rates and recycling efficiency values.
- Step 2: develop a circular BIM Information Delivery Manual, which lays down how the information is included in the source file.
- Step 3: development of a method that makes it possible, based on the uploaded source file, to make an estimate for the Design for Disassembly (stimulating high-value reuse) and Design for Recycling (stimulating low-value reuse). It is expected that in the rest of 2019/2020 work will be carried out on the realisation of the Design for Disassembly.

The quality of the source information will continue to determine the reliability of the Circularity Indicator. The provision of a source file with a high level of detail has a major influence on the quality of the indicator.
